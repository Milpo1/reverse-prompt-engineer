Some leather products can have a noticeable smell initially due to the tanning process. It's usually temporary and should dissipate over time. We recommend airing the jacket out in a well-ventilated area for a few days. If the smell persists after a week, please contact us again, and we'll be happy to explore other solutions, such as an exchange or return. We apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n}"
